Status
============================================================================
* build mostly completed but needs tidying up
  * missing assets folder
* test does not exec yeti yet
* no coverage (istanbul)

Seems that yeti *must* be run from a parent of the target directory. You cannot pass it an absolute URL.

TODO
============================================================================
  * add assets folders to build
* error checking
* --test
* * yeti --server forking (if possible)
* * yeti
* * connection to a hub/selenium/saucelabs/hudson/etc.
* coverage reporting
  * change build location to new jsunit_path

Original notes
============================================================================
Look for all **/tests/unit/config.json and open to parse with a structure:
```
{
    "YUI module name": {
        "testSuiteName": {
            "suites": [
                "list.js",
                "of.js",
                "js.js",
                "files.js"
            ],
            "html": "optionanMustacheSnippetForHTMLBody.mustache"
        }
    }
}
```
* For each object in the testSuite object:
** Compile a testSuite including:
*** all of the JS for each suites/[file.js] from tests/unit/suites/[file.js]
*** a sandwich of the header and footer from lib/yui/common/tests/*.mustache
*** any mustache content in html/[file.mustache] located in tests/unit/mustache/[file.mustache]
*** all content from tests/unit/assets into the build directory
** Build into ../../build/[moduleName]/tests/[testSuiteName]/index.html (complete with assets)
** Open the build.json file, and for each built file, build an istanbul instrumented version using the -debug.js version

Should cowtest be written in PHP or JavaScript?
* PHP:
** No special tools required to write most of the files (except istanbul which is optional)
** can make use of Moodle configuration files
** can make exec call to istanbul
** CLI only
** can be used to update a specific file only
** can fork yeti with all files or just those listed
** cache configuration in lib/yui/common/tests/YUI_config.js

cowtest [-b|--build] [-t|--test] [-c|--with-coverage] [-r|--reset-configuration] [frankenstyle-module-name]

jsunit?
cowtest?
cowunit?
moonit?
moojsunit

* copy all built JS + test files to new location?:
/dataroot/jsunit
    /sources
        /config
            /config.js
        /build
            /[module-name]
            /moodle-core-tooltip
    /tests
        /unit
            /[module-name]
                /[testSuite]
                    /index.html
            /moodle-core-tooltip
                /tooltip
                    /index.html
