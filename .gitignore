# This file specifies intentionally untracked files that all Moodle git
# repositories should ignore. It is recommended not to modify this file in your
# local clone. Instead, use .git/info/exclude and add new records there as
# needed.
#
# Example: if you deploy a contributed plugin mod/foobar into your site, put
# the following line into .git/info/exclude file in your Moodle clone:
# /mod/foobar/
#
# See gitignore(5) man page for more details
